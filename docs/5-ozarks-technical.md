title: "My Journey at Ozarks Technical Community College"
---

When I first decided to go back to college, it was during one of the most pivotal times of my life. I had just learned that I was going to become a father, and around the same time, I was laid off from the bricklayers union during the recession. Faced with a choice between drawing unemployment or finding a new path, I chose to pursue an education. I remember walking into the admissions office at Ozarks Technical Community College in Springfield, Missouri, with dusty jeans and a tape measure still on my belt from the jobsite. I told the woman at the desk, “If I can lay bricks, I can do anything. Sign me up.”

Initially, I aimed high—thinking about an MBA someday—but I started with computer science courses. I dove into learning about databases, programming basics, and all the foundational classes that would eventually support a degree. I also caught up on my general education requirements, including math, which I hadn’t touched in years. To my surprise and pride, I began earning straight A’s. 

Life was busy, to say the least. I was a full-time student taking 15 credit hours while also working full-time as the night manager for a local hotel and its restaurant. I was balancing the responsibilities of work, school, and being a new father. Those were some of the hardest and most rewarding days of my life.

Unfortunately, I didn’t finish my associate degree at OTC. Just as I was down to my last one or two classes—maybe a Spanish course and one more—life threw me another curveball. My son was taken by his mother to North Carolina after our divorce, and I had to uproot my life to follow. Completing school at that moment became impossible.

Even though I didn’t walk away with my degree then, my time at OTC was invaluable. I learned discipline, developed new skills in computer science, and proved to myself that I could excel academically. Those credits later transferred seamlessly to universities like the University of Tennessee, Pellissippi State, and ETSU, helping me continue my higher education journey.

Looking back, Ozarks Technical Community College was where I rebuilt my life. It was where I learned that grit and determination could carry me through any challenge—and that even in hard times, you can take the first step toward building something better.
