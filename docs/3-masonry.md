title: "Autobiographical Narrative: My Life in Masonry and Construction"
---

From the time I was old enough to carry a block, I was on construction sites with my family. My journey in masonry began in middle school, working for my grandfather’s company, Dickens Masonry. In those early days, my responsibilities were simple: stocking bricks, carrying materials, and learning the basics of spreading mortar—what we called “mud.” I would spend long summer days on job sites, watching my dad and grandfather work, slowly picking up the skills and habits that define a mason.

As I grew older, my responsibilities grew with me. I started performing saw cuts, building scaffolding, and assisting with more technical tasks. I eventually joined my grandfather on the road, hauling trailers loaded with scaffolding across Missouri, Iowa, Kansas, and Oklahoma. Preparing crews for jobs, making sure materials were delivered, and helping set up sites taught me early lessons about responsibility, planning, and teamwork.

By my late teens and early twenties, I was fully immersed in construction life. I worked alongside my uncle, a general contractor, where I pushed wheelbarrows, cleaned job sites, and labored wherever I was needed. My stepdad, also a general contractor, exposed me to the world of interior commercial work. Through him, I observed and sometimes assisted with cabinet installations, interior finishes, and other detailed aspects of building that contrasted with the heavy, exterior work of masonry.

After my grandfather passed away, I decided to take the next step and join the bricklayers union. This led me to work on large-scale projects across the region with my father, including major builds like the Republic High School in Republic, Missouri. I spent a couple of years on that job alone, learning not only the craft but also the discipline required to be part of a union crew. I became OSHA-trained, mastered the safe use of saws, jackhammers, demolition equipment, and heavy machinery, and developed an eye for structural integrity and building processes.

Being a bricklayer taught me more than just how to lay block and brick. It gave me an understanding of how buildings come together from the ground up—foundations, block walls, veneer brick, and the coordination required with electricians, plumbers, and other trades. I saw firsthand the importance of communication, safety, and precision in any team effort. These experiences instilled values of hard work, reliability, and problem-solving. I also learned leadership through example—whether it was organizing crews, managing materials, or helping keep jobs on schedule.

When the 2008 recession hit, I was laid off from union work. That turning point led me to return to school and explore new career paths. But the skills and work ethic I developed in construction have stayed with me. From discipline and safety awareness to adaptability and teamwork, my years in masonry shaped me into someone who can lead, manage, and persevere through challenging projects.

Bricklaying was more than a job—it was a foundation for the way I approach work and life today.
