title: "ForeMost Construction: Award-Winning Projects & Process Improvement"
---

I began my journey with ForeMost Construction as a project manager, diving headfirst into five major projects right from the start. ForeMost specialized in upscale vacation cabins in the Smoky Mountain region, along with large custom residential homes, and occasionally light commercial work. My role was a dynamic blend of hands-on construction and administrative management. I spent significant time preparing estimates, reviewing blueprints, gathering subcontractor proposals, and coordinating with contractors to ensure smooth project execution.

One of the highlights of my time with ForeMost was managing a luxury vacation cabin project that later went on to win an award from a regional architecture and design magazine. The recognition was especially rewarding because I was deeply involved in every step of that build—from coordinating materials and subcontractors to handling finishing details that elevated the cabin’s aesthetic and functionality. Seeing our work celebrated publicly reinforced the pride I took in ensuring quality craftsmanship and customer satisfaction.

In addition to the day-to-day responsibilities of visiting job sites, managing subcontractors, scheduling material deliveries, and handling warranty work, I also focused on improving the company’s internal processes. During my tenure, ForeMost transitioned to new project management and estimating software. Recognizing the need for a clear onboarding and operational system, I suggested creating a visual workflow to streamline training and maintain consistent practices. I designed and implemented a detailed flowchart that mapped out each step of the construction and administrative process, which became an invaluable tool for the team as the company scaled.

Equipped with my own tools (and eventually a company truck), I often stepped in for hands-on tasks like carpentry, installing large glass shower doors, or troubleshooting urgent electrical and plumbing issues on-site. Beyond the tools, I prioritized customer relations—keeping homeowners, neighbors, and surrounding businesses informed and satisfied throughout construction. My responsibilities also included pulling permits, maintaining code compliance, and ensuring every stakeholder stayed aligned.

This role allowed me to leverage both my certified construction management skills and my practical problem-solving abilities, giving me the opportunity to work across nearly every aspect of the construction process. When I eventually left ForeMost Construction, it was on excellent terms after working through my two-week notice. I relocated to North Carolina to be closer to my teenage son and to pursue new opportunities with A&D Precast, carrying forward the wealth of experience and professional growth I gained at ForeMost.
