title: "Summary: Following My Heart, Equipped with Tools"
---

In summary, I've always followed my heart, through both the good and the bad. Along the way, I’ve taken notes and learned valuable lessons to better equip myself for whatever challenges come my way. My grandfather taught me to always strive for perfection, reminding me that I don’t have to be the smartest person—I only need to be smarter than the object I’m working with. I believe that the tools make the person, and I’ve equipped myself with many, fully embracing technology to meet each challenge head-on.
