title: "Turning Around Cherokee Mills: My Autobiographical Story"
---

When I joined Commercial and Investment Properties in Knoxville, Tennessee, they entrusted me with a unique responsibility: I was hired as the sole maintenance technician for Cherokee Mills, a historic 100-year-old textile mill that had been transformed into roughly 250,000 square feet of commercial office space. The property housed more than 22 tenants at any given time, ranging from medical offices and accounting firms to architectural practices, a restaurant, a software company, and an insurance agency. I was, in a sense, the building’s caretaker, problem-solver, and engineer all in one.

Cherokee Mills had character, but it also carried the weight of decades of neglect. The mill had been built in stages, which meant that no two areas were quite alike. Different roof styles intersected—metal, membrane, and pitched—each with its own set of quirks and leaks. The floors varied just as much, and every system seemed to tell a story of piecemeal updates over the years. My first months were spent organizing chaos: cleaning out storage rooms and closets, cataloging keys and locks, and mapping out the building using AutoCAD so I could locate drains, plumbing, and low-voltage lines.

Day to day, my work was a mixture of routine maintenance and creative problem-solving. I supervised subcontractors and general contractors during tenant build-outs, making sure each space was transformed efficiently and safely. I converted the entire building’s lighting to LED, modernized the elevator phones to digital low-voltage systems, and spent nights on fire watch when we upgraded the sprinkler system. There were times I felt more like a building engineer than a maintenance technician—handling HVAC troubleshooting, electrical repairs, and fire system maintenance, often after hours or on weekends to avoid disrupting tenants.

For two years, I poured myself into Cherokee Mills. I took pride not just in fixing immediate problems, but in giving the property a true facelift and creating a reliable maintenance structure for the future. The tenants came to trust me, and my relationships with subcontractors became invaluable for larger projects. Slowly but surely, the mill went from a neglected property to a polished, fully functioning hub of business.

Balancing the job while attending school was demanding, and as I neared graduation, I realized my ambitions were shifting toward project or construction management. Commercial and Investment Properties was a small company, with limited roles beyond maintenance, and they were preparing to sell Cherokee Mills. It felt like an appropriate time to move on, though leaving was bittersweet. My two-week notice was emotional for all of us; the property manager in particular expressed deep gratitude for the energy and dedication I had given to the building.

Looking back, my time at Cherokee Mills was more than a job—it was a hands-on education in building systems, tenant relations, and creative problem-solving. I left knowing that I had truly made a difference, breathing new life into a century-old structure and sharpening the skills that would propel me into the next stage of my career.
