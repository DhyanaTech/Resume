title: "My Experience at A & D Precast"
---

When I first interviewed with A & D Precast, I was told they were a vertically integrated company and that my role as Account Manager would involve creating shop drawings in AutoCAD Inventor, as well as handling estimates and takeoffs. They offered to cover my relocation, and I was eager to join a company with decades of experience in the niche market of architectural precast concrete.

From my first day, I quickly realized that “vertical integration” meant something very different there: everyone wore multiple hats. Designers were also salespeople, handled administrative tasks, and managed their own projects. While the company had been in business for nearly 30 years, operations were highly disorganized and lacked reliable systems. There was no clear tracking of quotes versus sales, no accurate cost-of-goods calculations, and no meaningful analytics to guide decision-making.

Over time, I worked to bring structure to the chaos. I created tools to estimate the cost per pound of our products, which allowed me to calculate margins and develop KPIs like pipeline value. I also immersed myself in the company’s fragmented technology stack, which relied on spreadsheets, CSV files, and macros. Attempts to implement software solutions—such as Microsoft Dynamics 365 and Idencia for production tracking—were unsuccessful, leaving much of the process manual and unreliable.

In my own time, I researched better solutions, attending an industry trade show and exploring software built for architectural precast. Most were outdated or insufficient, so I began building my own database and workflow tools to automate processes and improve efficiency. After a year, I presented a comprehensive proposal to improve operations: establishing defined roles, building a cohesive team, implementing better technology, and creating career paths to strengthen employee retention. I even offered a profit-sharing model for a system I developed independently to help the company scale.

Unfortunately, my vision for growth did not align with the company’s direction. Shortly after submitting my proposal, I was unexpectedly let go. While it was disappointing, the experience gave me valuable insight into managing complex operations, developing business analytics, and creating solutions for niche manufacturing industries. My time at A & D Precast ultimately reinforced my passion for process improvement and scalable systems, and the lessons I learned there continue to inform my professional journey today.
