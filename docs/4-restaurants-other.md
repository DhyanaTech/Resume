title: "Restaurant & Early Work Experience"
---

I began my working life before I was even old enough to drive, getting my first real job at Celebration Station in Knoxville, Tennessee. I was hired as a video game technician, responsible for repairing and maintaining the arcade machines for customers. That job gave me my first real exposure to corporate structure, training programs, and how organized systems support a business. I quickly learned about cross-departmental training, organizational charts, and the importance of clear supervision. I was eventually promoted to trainer, mentoring new employees, and if I hadn’t been a minor, I likely would have been offered a supervisor role. That early experience left a lasting impression on me about the value of structured training and development programs.

During my teenage years, I also worked at Wendy’s in Knoxville, Tennessee and later in Hatboro, Pennsylvania. Those positions taught me a great deal about consistency and the power of corporate training programs. I saw firsthand how customers could walk into any location and expect the same product and experience, and I developed an appreciation for the systems and processes that make that possible.

As I grew older, I moved deeper into restaurant work, spending significant time waiting tables at The Gondolier. I learned both front-of-house and back-of-house operations, becoming a highly knowledgeable and reliable team member. My skills as a server and my ability to understand kitchen operations gave me a unique edge. It was actually through this job that I was recruited to become a facilities manager for the Fabulous Family Fun Center in Hickory, North Carolina. The owners, a husband-and-wife team, had trained at my Gondolier location before opening their own family amusement center with go-karts, batting cages, and arcades. They admired my work ethic and offered me the management role. This was an incredible opportunity to oversee operations, manage staff, and learn the realities of small business ownership. I gained invaluable insight into both the successes and the struggles of running a family-owned business.

Along the way, I spent time working in other restaurants like Trips and Rafferty’s, where I handled both serving and kitchen duties. These experiences reinforced the importance of teamwork, cross-training, and staying calm under pressure. Working in high-stress, fast-paced environments taught me how to think on my feet, manage customer expectations, and push through challenging situations—skills that have proven useful far beyond the restaurant industry.

During my college years at the University of Tennessee, I also balanced working as a bartender at The Urban Bar in Knoxville. This role allowed me to work nights and attend classes during the day, further sharpening my ability to manage time and handle stressful, customer-facing situations. Later, while studying engineering technology at Pellissippi State and working for ForeMost Construction, I also worked evenings as a Starbucks barista. My time there introduced me to Starbucks’ highly organized and inclusive corporate culture. I learned about their use of technology for operational efficiency and their commitment to cross-training and team development, and even though my tenure was under a year, the experience left a strong impression.

All of these experiences—spanning arcades, restaurants, bars, and coffee shops—gave me a wide range of transferable skills in customer service, leadership, and business operations. I learned to thrive in high-pressure environments, to manage teams effectively, and to appreciate the systems that make businesses consistent and successful. Equally important, I developed a lifelong respect for hard work, teamwork, and the value of learning from every role, no matter how small it might seem at the time.
