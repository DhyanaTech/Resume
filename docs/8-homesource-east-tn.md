title: "My Time at Homesource of East Tennessee"
---

Working at Homesource of East Tennessee was one of the most formative experiences of my career. Homesource, a nonprofit property management organization based in Knoxville, Tennessee, is dedicated to providing homes for low-income families, senior citizens, and people with disabilities. During my time there, I served on the maintenance team, helping to care for nearly 300 properties spread across several counties. Our portfolio included everything from small single-family houses to larger apartment complexes.

My days were rarely the same. A big part of my work involved “turns”—preparing units for new tenants after someone moved out. That meant handling a wide array of tasks: electrical repairs, plumbing fixes, carpentry, drywall finishing, flooring, and sometimes coordinating with subcontractors. I took pride in keeping my work truck organized and stocked with the essential tools and materials needed to tackle any maintenance call. If a job required specialty supplies, I would head to the hardware store with the company credit card or check our shop for stocked materials.

From time to time, I also worked for the general contractor side of the company, assisting with construction projects like building senior apartment homes. One of the highlights was using my bricklaying skills on a restoration project—an opportunity to bring my past experience into my day-to-day work. Every project came with its challenges, but there was always a sense of purpose: we were improving homes for people who truly needed them.

Being part of Homesource meant more than just fixing things. We interacted directly with tenants, and I learned how important it was to be approachable, understanding, and patient. We rotated on-call duty, handling emergency repairs at all hours of the night. When the phone rang, I had to be ready to jump in the truck and head to whichever property needed immediate attention.

Because Homesource relied heavily on grants and federal funding, compliance was critical. We had to maintain high standards to pass inspections and meet all regulatory requirements. That discipline taught me the value of doing things correctly the first time, no matter how small the task.

I worked at Homesource during the COVID-19 pandemic, which made everything even more challenging. As essential workers, we continued caring for the properties while most of the world was in lockdown. Extra precautions, PPE, and social distancing were mandatory—especially when working with our senior residents, who were the most vulnerable.

Leaving Homesource was bittersweet. I enjoyed the variety of the work, the camaraderie of the maintenance team, and the satisfaction of knowing that my efforts directly impacted the lives of people in need. I even had the unique privilege of maintaining a property where my own grandmother lived, occasionally running into her during my rounds. But as much as I loved the mission, I needed a higher wage to support my family of three children. Eventually, I transitioned to a commercial maintenance role, which provided better financial stability.

Even now, I look back on my time at Homesource with pride. It was a period of hard work, problem-solving, and personal growth—an experience that strengthened not only my skills as a handyman but also my appreciation for the importance of safe, well-cared-for homes in people’s lives.
