title: "University of Tennessee: Growth, Learning, and Perseverance"
---

During my time at the University of Tennessee, my journey was as much about personal growth as it was about academics. I enrolled at UT after moving back to Knoxville to be closer to my son and family. Being a father was my top priority—I wanted to be present in his life with regular visits, to support him, and to be a role model he could look up to. My hope was that by pursuing higher education, I would inspire him to value learning and perseverance when his time as a student came.

I auditioned for the School of Music and was admitted as a musicology major. For about four semesters, I immersed myself in music. I was a member of the men’s chorus, took piano lessons, and engaged in all the extra requirements that come with being a music student: ear training sessions, rehearsals, and one-credit courses that demanded hours of work. The workload was intense, especially because I was also working full-time in restaurants and bars to make ends meet and to cover child support. Balancing my responsibilities as a nontraditional student in my 30s, a father, and a full-time worker was incredibly challenging.

Eventually, I realized that continuing as a music major would be nearly impossible under those circumstances, so I changed my major to Communications. While studying at UT, I explored a wide range of experiences. I worked as a student teacher for fourth graders in math and science, which was a rewarding opportunity to inspire young students and engage with education from another perspective. I took an advanced sound design course and worked at the Clarence Brown Theatre, diving into sound engineering and learning to navigate complex audio software—skills that also connected to user interface and user experience design.

One of the most unique experiences I had was participating in a year-long, doctoral-level course at the Bredesen Center focused on energy science. Despite being an undergraduate, I was surrounded by nuclear physicists and top-level science students. The class covered advanced physics, energy policy, and sustainable technologies. Our final project tackled innovative energy solutions, and my group focused on carbon capture devices for power plants. Presenting our work to the former governor, Phil Bredesen, was both humbling and inspiring. While some of the physics was over my head, the class fed my lifelong curiosity about how things work and deepened my love for science and technology.

In addition to my core studies, I explored classes in poetry, planetary science, geology, and calculus. I was fascinated by so many subjects that I accumulated over 120 credit hours, driven by a genuine love of learning rather than strict specialization. My curiosity often led me to sign up for classes just because a hallway poster sparked my interest.

Ultimately, financial constraints forced me to put my education on hold. Yet, my time at the University of Tennessee was transformative. It taught me resilience, curiosity, and the importance of balancing ambition with responsibility. Through all the late nights, hard work, and constant juggling of school, work, and fatherhood, I never lost sight of my goal: to better myself and set an example for my son. My journey at UT was not just about earning credits—it was about growth, determination, and the pursuit of a brighter future for both of us.
