title: "McCracken Construction: Lessons in Ethics and Professional Standards"
---

During my time at McCracken Construction and Maintenance Company in Maryville, Tennessee, I gained an eye-opening perspective on the importance of ethics and professional standards in the construction industry. I initially joined the company as an estimator, eager to contribute to new projects and hone my skills in design and planning. Early on, I was tasked with responsibilities such as creating plans for improvements to an ADA ramp for one of the company’s commercial properties and working on projects for the new Midland Shopping Center, which was the company’s primary local focus. My office was set up in a converted storage business, which also operated alongside a liquor store and a sub sandwich shop owned by the company.

As I settled into the role, I quickly began to notice troubling patterns that raised serious red flags. The company was operating without a contractor’s license, taking on construction projects across multiple states, and often doing so without the proper permits. At one point, after a fire at the sandwich shop, I was even asked to retrieve metal shopping cart corrals from a local business that was shutting down—essentially a request that felt like larceny. The overall environment in the office was equally concerning, with frequent vulgar language, locker-room talk, and instances of inappropriate behavior that made the workplace unprofessional and uncomfortable.

The CEO himself maintained an apartment within the storage unit business, where he would occasionally hold meetings, adding yet another layer of awkwardness to an already unusual and ethically challenging work environment. The combination of operating without proper licensing, the expectation to participate in unethical activities, and the inappropriate workplace culture made it clear that this was not a place where I could thrive or safely continue my career.

Ultimately, I made the difficult but necessary decision to resign on short notice. I prioritized protecting my own professional integrity and ensuring that I would not be personally liable for the company’s actions. Leaving McCracken Construction and Maintenance taught me invaluable lessons about leadership, accountability, and the non-negotiable role that ethics play in any business. Moving forward, I have carried these experiences with me, committed to seeking opportunities where integrity and professionalism are at the core of the work environment.
