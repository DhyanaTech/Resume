title: "About Me: Family, Creativity, and Purpose"
---

My name is Steve Dickens, and at 42 years old, I find myself in a season of life centered on family, creativity, and discovery. I was born in Springfield, Missouri, and my childhood was shaped by moves and travel between states. When I was a young child, my parents moved our family first to Florida and then to Knoxville, Tennessee, by the time I was in third grade. With my parents divorced, I spent my upbringing moving back and forth between Missouri and Knoxville, learning to adapt, discovering my independence, and developing an appreciation for different places and experiences.

Today, I live in Hickory, North Carolina, with my son, Brydon, who is in high school. I also spend part of my time in Knoxville with my wife, Sarah, and her two children, Ethan and Avery. Together, we are focused on raising our teenagers, teaching them the skills and values we believe will help them thrive as they grow into young adults.

Creativity has always been at the heart of who I am. I am a poet and a musician, playing guitar, piano, and banjo, and I love writing songs that reflect my experiences and the world around me. Nature is my constant source of inspiration. I hike, mountain bike, camp, and explore the beauty of Western North Carolina and East Tennessee, always in search of quiet places and hidden stories in the landscapes and history around me.

From a young age, I developed a love for problem-solving and design. I built my first computer in middle school, and that curiosity has stayed with me ever since. I enjoy understanding how things work, fixing what’s broken, and creating solutions that make life simpler and more efficient. I believe in being a self-starter, learning constantly, and working smart to make a meaningful impact.

At the core of my life is a simple philosophy: leave the world better than you found it. Through music, family, technology, and teaching, I aim to live with purpose, creativity, and kindness, always striving to pass on what I’ve learned and to make the world a little brighter for those around me.
