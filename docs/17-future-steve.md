title: "Looking Ahead: Open to Possibilities"
---

In this moment of my life, I feel like I'm standing on the edge of a cliff, ready to leap and build the plane as I fall—the classic small business owner's metaphor. I’ve just created my own company, and while it’s still pre-revenue, the potential excites me. I’m wide open to possibilities: looking for partners, a team, mentorship, or even discovering a role in another company that recognizes my value and aligns with my principles. Wherever I land, I want to bring my diverse skills and life experience to shine, to solve problems creatively, and to help something meaningful grow.

I’ve always been a natural problem-solver, a kind of “Mr. Fix-It.” I thrive in situations where I can make systems more efficient, improve processes, or find creative solutions to tricky challenges. Whether in operations, software development, organizational leadership, or just rolling up my sleeves to help where needed, I have a lot to offer. I love blending my technical skills with my creative side—my passion for music, poetry, and art—to approach problems from unique angles.

Right now, my life is tied to the Charlotte and Knoxville region because I have teenagers at home, with my youngest still in middle school. In about five years, when she heads off to college, I’ll be more open to relocating. In the meantime, I’m completely capable of working remotely and supporting any company, anywhere in the world, if they see the potential in what I can contribute. I’m flexible about travel, willing to fly or drive as needed, though I prefer trips that keep me away for no more than a week at a time, with the understanding that expenses would be covered.

The future feels wide open, and that’s both exhilarating and humbling. As Tom Petty said, “the future is wide open,” and I’m excited for the next chapter. I have ideas for making the world a better place—from supporting sustainability efforts to helping companies reduce their carbon footprint and operate more efficiently. I know that the right opportunity will allow me to put my creativity, skills, and passion to work, whether that’s growing my own venture or contributing to a team that feels like home. I’ve had my share of challenges and triumphs, and through it all, I’ve learned that my greatest strength is my adaptability and my drive to help things get better. My goal is to find the place where I can truly belong and make a difference.
