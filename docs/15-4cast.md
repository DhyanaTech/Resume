title: "My Journey to Creating DhyanaTech Inc."
---

I never set out to become a business owner, let alone a software developer. But the challenges I faced in my career sparked something deeper—a desire to build tools that actually serve people, not frustrate them.

It started at an architectural precast manufacturer where I managed estimating, accounts, and production operations. The company's systems were chaotic. Critical data was scattered across multiple spreadsheets, often missing or incomplete. When spreadsheets became too large, we'd create new ones, introducing more room for error. Production staff would accidentally delete rows or columns, and manually transferring CSV files with macros became a daily headache. The company tried Microsoft 365 Power Apps, Dynamics, and out-of-the-box SaaS solutions—but after nearly two years of development with third-party developers, none of it worked. They were using the wrong tools for the job.

I used to joke, "If I had the time, I could just build the software myself." Eventually, that joke became a plan. I spent nights, weekends, and holidays building a fully functional mini-ERP from scratch. In eight months, I had a system with RFID tag tracking, Zebra label printer integration, and automated workflows that eliminated manual CSV transfers. This became 4Cast—a solution born from necessity.

But I realized I needed more than technical skills to bring this vision to market. I built MyTinyCEO as a tool for market research, financial modeling, and preparing investor materials for my own venture. It helped me understand the business landscape and crystallize my strategy.

Working on both projects, I noticed something: my approach to building software was fundamentally different from what I'd seen in the industry. I wasn't just trying to pack in features—I was trying to reduce friction. Too much software is built without purpose, adding complexity rather than clarity.

This realization coincided with a personal transformation. I had been practicing mindfulness in my own life, learning to slow down and pay attention to what actually matters. I began to see how the stress of chaotic work systems wasn't just an operational problem—it was a wellbeing problem. The noise and friction of poorly designed tools affects not just productivity but mental health.

That's when DhyanaTech Inc. was born. The name comes from "Dhyana," the Sanskrit word for meditation—a state of focused awareness and clarity. I founded DhyanaTech to build technology more mindfully, creating tools that enable people to work with less friction and less stress, so they have more time and energy left for the parts of life that matter outside of work.

4Cast and MyTinyCEO became the foundation of the DhyanaTech ecosystem, evolving into DhyanaPM for project management and DhyanaCFO for financial clarity. Each product emphasizes simplicity over complexity, purpose over feature bloat.

Building DhyanaTech has forced me to grow as a leader. I've learned entrepreneurship, finance, marketing, HR, compliance, and team-building—what it truly means to be a CEO. My goal is to empower small businesses with innovative tools that simplify operations, improve efficiency, and ultimately contribute to a healthier, more focused society.

Everything I've learned—from coding and AI to leadership and mindfulness—has shaped DhyanaTech Inc. This journey is just beginning, but I believe the tools I'm building can change how people experience their work and, by extension, their lives.
