title: "My Journey to Creating 4Cast Concrete Solutions LLC"
---

I never set out to become a business owner, let alone a software developer for the precast concrete industry. But the challenges I faced in my previous job sparked the idea for 4Cast Concrete Solutions LLC.

I was working for an architectural precast manufacturer, and my role involved estimating, managing accounts, and supporting production operations. The company’s systems were chaotic. Critical data was scattered across multiple spreadsheets, often missing or incomplete. Once spreadsheets became too large, we’d have to create new ones, which introduced even more room for error. Production staff would sometimes accidentally delete rows or columns, and manually transferring CSV files with macros became a daily headache. The inefficiency was overwhelming.

The company tried to modernize by adopting Microsoft 365 Power Apps and Dynamics, as well as an out-of-the-box SaaS solution for the production site. But after nearly two years of development and work with third-party developers, none of it worked. They were using the wrong tools for the job—trying to force a quality control software into handling inventory and production tracking. Even the fragmented approach with multiple apps still left huge gaps in efficiency and data integrity.

I used to joke, “If I had the time, I could just build the software myself.” Eventually, that joke became a plan. I started researching, attending trade shows, and meeting with developers who offered either expensive custom solutions—like Oracle, Odoo, or FileMaker Pro—or out-of-the-box software made for civil precast manufacturers. But none of them fit the unique needs of the architectural precast industry. Meanwhile, my job remained unnecessarily difficult.

So I decided to take matters into my own hands. I spent nights, weekends, and holidays building a fully functional mini-ERP from scratch for our small business. In just eight months, I had a system with RFID tag tracking, Zebra label printer integration, and automated workflows that eliminated the need for manual CSV transfers and macros. It improved data integrity, streamlined production tracking, and gave the business owners better analytics and decision-making tools. I even leveraged AI to optimize production schedules and improve customer lead-time predictions.

This success made me realize that many other manufacturers struggled with the same problems. I knew I could help them. That’s how 4Cast Concrete Solutions LLC was born—a company dedicated to providing smarter, AI-driven solutions for manufacturers like ours.

I’ve since expanded my vision to include a suite of tools: AI-powered 3D shop drawing generators, intelligent takeoff software, and even MyTinyCEO, a market analysis and executive summary tool for small businesses. Drawing on the computer science foundations I gained at Ozark Technical Community College, I taught myself modern development, UX/UI design, AI prompt engineering, and the architecture of scalable solutions.

Building 4Cast has also forced me to grow as a leader. I dove into entrepreneurship, finance, marketing, HR, compliance, and team-building—learning what it truly means to be a CEO. I’m still in a pre-revenue stage, but I’m ambitious and optimistic. My goal is to empower other small businesses with innovative tools that simplify operations, improve efficiency, and ultimately drive economic growth.

Everything I’ve learned—from coding and AI to leadership and strategic thinking—has shaped 4Cast Concrete Solutions LLC. This journey is just beginning, but I believe the tools I’m building can change how small manufacturers operate and thrive.
