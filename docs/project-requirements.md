🎨 Color Usage Guide
1. Denim Blue (#457B9D) – Primary / Anchor Color
Use for headers, buttons, and navigation bars to establish a calm, trustworthy presence.
Great for links and icons too — it balances vibrancy and professionalism.
2. Sunflower Yellow (#F4D35E) – Accent / Energy Pop
Ideal for call-to-action buttons, hover effects, and highlighted elements (like icons or borders).
A little goes a long way — this color brings cheerful warmth and keeps the palette from feeling too muted.
3. Bamboo Green (#2A9D8F) – Secondary / Natural Flow
Use for section dividers, subheadings, or background tints on cards or feature boxes.
It harmonizes beautifully with both the blue and yellow while maintaining a grounded, organic tone.
4. Cream (#F5F5E0) – Base / Background
Perfect for page backgrounds, content areas, and white space.
Keeps your design light, airy, and easy on the eyes, especially when paired with darker text colors
